For these demos, there are 2 main setups. (not sure best way to describe this, so terminology may change).

The "-local" examples are setup to not pull the mapping module from the NPM repository, but rather pull from the code at the root (remember to build it). This is useful for developing new features for the library.

The other examples pull down the babylonjs-mapping module from NPM, and are "standalone".
