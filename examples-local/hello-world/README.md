# IEEE VR 2021 Web-Based VR Tutorial

This is a simple example of a Babylon.js project.

To work with this sample, you should have Node (and in particular, npm and npx) installed, which you can retrieve from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).  

## Running 

You set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from npm with 
```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:
```
npm run start
```

For those familiar with Typescript, you do not have to run ```tsc``` to build the .js files from the .ts files;  ```npx``` builds them on the fly as part of running webpack.

You can run the sample by pointing your web browser at ```https://localhost:8080/index.html```
